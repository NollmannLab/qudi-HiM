# qudi-HiM

qudi-HiM is a software package developed by the [Nollmann Lab](http://www.nollmannlab.org) at the [Center of Structural Biology](http://www.cbs.cnrs.fr), a department of the [CNRS](http://www.cnrs.fr) and the [INSERM](http://www.inserm.fr). qudi-HiM is a tool for the control of optical microscope setups with different hardware components optimized to performed multiplexed imaging experiments. qudi-HiM has been build using a modular approach so that it can be adapted to different microscopes with various optical modalities (e.g. widefield/ confocal) and hardward components by using local configuration files. The graphical user interface (GUI) was build using pyQt.

qudi-HiM is built using the framework provided by [Qudi](https://github.com/Ulm-IQO/qudi), a suite of tools for operating multi-instrument and multi-computer laboratory experiments. The [Qudi](https://github.com/Ulm-IQO/qudi) Github repository contains a detailed documentation for users as well as guidelines for contributors.
